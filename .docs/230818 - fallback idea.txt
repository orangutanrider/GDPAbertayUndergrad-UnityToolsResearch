so the idea is to have it display these in the inspector

if this isn't possilbe i could create a custom inspector that displays these alone itself

the reason i consider that is because i'm wondering if doing this entails creating a custom editor for every script (unless i do it like this)

I think it should be possible just in the inspector though
