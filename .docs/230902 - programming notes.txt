========
it needs to use the serialilzed object reference to decide where and what its messages are

the editor thingy needs to store something right
yeh
the editor message function needs to send the scriptable objects that it is sending messages on basically

========
the data needs to be combined
how to do that?

one option is to have each help message provider contain a field for editor messages
hmm, dunno about this though

okay no
just go through each component instead of going through each messages object

okay no i can't do that...

hmm
this sucks

okay yeh
these just needs to be a master list that these guys all write to
and the master list contains one entry per component
