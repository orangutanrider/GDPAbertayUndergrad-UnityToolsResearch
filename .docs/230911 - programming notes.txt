========
when a class definition is found
scroll up until a trivia element matching of kind single line documentation comment is found
or if any non-trivia element is found before that, then stop looking

okay never mind
i can just use this thing GetLeadingTrivia()

========
open set, closed set
scan first node for all namespace and class declerations
add to open set
scan open set for the same, if nothing found add to closed set
if node is in the closed set, do not scan
return all documentation comments

========
Okay
What now?

get it to specifically print documentation comments

get it to print the first documentation comment declared nearest to the class

get it to print the summary inside that documentation comment

get it to apply new lines based on paragraph xml tags

get it to remove xml tags that the code doesn't know what to do with
