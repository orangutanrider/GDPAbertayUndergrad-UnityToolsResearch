Discovery:
It just doesn't work if you try and draw them all at once, outside the OnGUI function
It simply doesn't
What this means, is that it'll be impossible to group all field under the RequiredReference thing when they're mixed in with other fields
This is relevant when dealing with base class fields
This is unfortunate, but the project is still be useful without that functionality

Although, theoretically this could be fixed via a custom inspector
Still though, I don't like this option
One reason is that I've not made anything like it before; it'll take a while and I could be wrong about it being possible this way
And another reason is that it creates friction between what inspector is important; I imagine the original inspector just being forgotten about, If I do this.
That is bad because it'll just end up being all messy on that end

Hmm, I think there is one option regarding this.
I could to the thing the GameDevGuide guy did, where if the thing uses a custom inspector, then the original inspector just hosts a button for opening that custom inspector
This way, the original inspector is still what you mainly look to

It seems like all the EditorGUI functions are required to be executed inside the OnGUI function in order to do anything...

The whole thing needs to get moved down by one field so i can fit in the foldout header
However, first of all, it may be a good idea to see If I can even get the foldout header to draw at all
