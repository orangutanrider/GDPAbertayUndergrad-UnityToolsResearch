Okay
If I'm straight up making a interpreter compiler kind of thing
Then there needs to be some basis to how I'm gonna make this thing work

I think first idea is to have it read letter by letter or word by word
and then it decides if something is a word or not via if its got spaces or new lines around it

hmm, there are some special characters aswell though
stuff like () are also kind of seperators

and then whenver it comes across a { or a }
it needs to increment somekind of nesting counter
